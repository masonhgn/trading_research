# What is Quantitative Trading?
## Slide 2: Definition

**Quantitative Trading (Quant Trading)**

The use of mathematical models, statistical analysis, and computer algorithms to identify and execute trading opportunities.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Data-driven decision making
- Systematic, rules-based approach
- Minimal human emotion
- Testable strategies

# Understanding US Equities
## Slide 3: What Are Equities?

**Equities (Stocks)**

Represent ownership in a company. When you buy a share of stock, you own a small piece of that company.

**Major US Exchanges:**
- **NYSE**: New York Stock Exchange (blue-chip companies)
- **NASDAQ**: Technology-focused exchange
- **AMEX**: Smaller exchange (ETFs and options)

---




# Long vs Short Positions
## Slide 4: Long Position

**Long Position (Going Long)**

**Definition**: Buying an asset with the expectation that its price will rise.

**How it Works:**
1. Buy shares at current market price
2. Hold the shares
3. Sell later at a higher price
4. Profit = Selling Price - Buying Price

**Example:**
- Buy 100 shares of AAPL at $150 = $15,000
- AAPL rises to $160
- Sell 100 shares = $16,000
- **Profit = $1,000 (6.67% return)**

**Risk**: If price falls, you lose money

---




# Long vs Short Positions
## Slide 5: Short Position

**Short Position (Going Short)**

**Definition**: Selling an asset you don't own, expecting the price to fall.

**How it Works:**
1. Borrow shares from your broker
2. Sell borrowed shares at current price
3. Buy back shares later at lower price
4. Return borrowed shares to broker
5. Profit = Selling Price - Buying Price

**Example:**
- Borrow 100 shares of TSLA
- Sell at $200 = $20,000 cash
- TSLA falls to $180
- Buy back at $180 = $18,000
- **Profit = $2,000 (10% return)**

**Risk**: If price rises, losses can be unlimited

---




# Long vs Short Positions
## Slide 6: Key Differences

| Aspect | Long Position | Short Position |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| **Direction** | Bet on price increase | Bet on price decrease |
| **Maximum Loss** | Limited to investment | Potentially unlimited |
| **Maximum Gain** | Unlimited | Limited to 100% |
| **Borrowing** | Not required | Must borrow shares |
| **Dividends** | Receive dividends | Pay dividends to lender |
| **Margin** | Usually 50% | Usually 150% |

---




# Opening and Closing Positions
## Slide 7: The Four Position Types

**Four Fundamental Trading Actions:**

1. **Open to Buy (Long)**
   - Buy shares you don't own
   - Creates a long position
   - Example: Buy 100 shares of AAPL at $150

2. **Open to Sell (Short)**
   - Sell shares you don't own (borrowed)
   - Creates a short position
   - Example: Sell 100 shares of TSLA at $200

3. **Close to Buy**
   - Buy shares to close short position
   - Eliminates a short position
   - Example: Buy back TSLA shares at $180

4. **Close to Sell**
   - Sell shares you own
   - Eliminates a long position
   - Example: Sell AAPL shares at $160

---




# Opening and Closing Positions
## Slide 8: Position Lifecycle

**Position Lifecycle:**

```
Open to Buy → [Hold Long Position] → Close to Sell
Open to Sell → [Hold Short Position] → Close to Buy
```

**Key Point**: Every position must be opened and closed with opposite actions.

---




# Statistical Arbitrage Strategy
## Slide 9: What is Statistical Arbitrage?

**Statistical Arbitrage (Stat Arb)**

A market-neutral strategy that exploits temporary price inefficiencies between related assets.

**Core Concept**: Instead of betting on market direction, we bet on the **relationship** between assets.

**Key Insight**: We're not predicting if the market goes up or down - we're predicting if the spread between assets will converge or diverge.

---




# Statistical Arbitrage Strategy
## Slide 10: How It Works

**The Process:**

1. **Identify Related Assets**: Find assets that move together (e.g., SPY and VOO)

2. **Calculate the Spread**: Spread = Asset A Price - Asset B Price

3. **Measure Deviation**: How far is current spread from historical average?

4. **Trade the Spread**:
   - Wide spread: Short expensive, long cheap
   - Narrow spread: Long expensive, short cheap

5. **Wait for Convergence**: Profit when spread returns to normal

---




# Statistical Arbitrage Strategy
## Slide 11: Market-Neutral Approach

**Market-Neutral Strategy**

By simultaneously opening both long and short positions:

- **Long Position**: Buy the "cheap" asset
- **Short Position**: Sell the "expensive" asset
- **Net Market Exposure**: Approximately zero

**Result**: We're not betting on market direction - we're betting on the relationship between assets.

**Advantage**: Can profit regardless of overall market movement.

---




# Statistical Arbitrage Strategy
## Slide 12: Example - SPY vs VOO

**Scenario:**
- SPY trading at $500
- VOO trading at $499.50
- **Spread**: $500 - $499.50 = $0.50
- **Historical Average Spread**: $0.20
- **Current Spread**: $0.50 (wider than average)

**Trade:**
- **Open to Sell SPY**: Short at $500
- **Open to Buy VOO**: Long at $499.50

**Outcome** (if spread converges to $0.20):
- SPY falls to $499.70, VOO rises to $499.50
- **Profit**: $0.30 per share on both positions
- **Total Profit**: $0.60 per share pair

# Trading Strategies: The Foundation
## Slide 13: What is a Trading Strategy?

**Trading Strategy**

A systematic approach to buying and selling financial instruments based on specific rules, patterns, or signals.

**Components:**
- Signal generation (when to trade)
- Position sizing (how much to trade)
- Risk management (how to protect capital)
- Execution (how to place trades)

---




# Trading Strategies: The Foundation
## Slide 14: Simple Signal Example - MACD

**MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**

**How MACD Works:**
1. Calculate 12-day exponential moving average (EMA)
2. Calculate 26-day exponential moving average (EMA)
3. MACD Line = 12-day EMA - 26-day EMA
4. Signal Line = 9-day EMA of MACD Line
5. Histogram = MACD Line - Signal Line

**Trading Rules:**
- **Buy Signal**: MACD Line crosses above Signal Line
- **Sell Signal**: MACD Line crosses below Signal Line

---




# Strategy Categories
## Slide 15: Momentum Strategies

**Momentum Strategies**

**Concept**: Buy assets that have performed well recently, expecting continued performance.

**Core Idea**: "The trend is your friend" - assets moving in a direction tend to continue.

**Examples:**
- Relative Strength: Buy outperforming stocks
- Moving Average Crossover: Buy when short-term MA crosses above long-term MA
- Breakout Trading: Buy when price breaks above resistance

**Pros**: Can capture strong trends and large moves
**Cons**: Vulnerable to reversals, can lag market changes

---




# Strategy Categories
## Slide 16: Mean Reversion Strategies

**Mean Reversion Strategies**

**Concept**: Buy assets that have fallen below their average, sell assets that have risen above their average.

**Core Idea**: "What goes up must come down" - prices tend to return to historical averages.

**Examples:**
- Bollinger Bands: Buy at lower band, sell at upper band
- Pairs Trading: Buy underperformer, sell outperformer in same sector
- Statistical Arbitrage: Trade when z-score indicates extreme deviation

**Pros**: Works well in sideways markets, can be market neutral
**Cons**: Can lose money in strong trends, requires statistical sophistication

---




# Performance Metrics: Measuring Success
## Slide 17: Return Metrics

**Return Metrics**

**1. Total Return**
- Formula: (Ending Value - Beginning Value) / Beginning Value
- Example: $100,000 → $110,000 = 10% return

**2. Annualized Return**
- Formula: (1 + Total Return)^(252/Trading Days) - 1
- Example: 6-month 5% return → 10.25% annualized

**3. Alpha (Excess Return)**
- Formula: Strategy Return - Benchmark Return
- Example: Strategy 12% vs Market 10% = 2% alpha

---




# Performance Metrics: Measuring Success
## Slide 18: Risk Metrics

**Risk Metrics**

**1. Volatility (Standard Deviation)**
- Formula: √(Σ(Return - Mean Return)² / (n-1))
- Interpretation: Higher volatility = higher risk
- Example: Daily returns [1%, -2%, 3%, -1%, 2%] → 2.1% volatility

**2. Maximum Drawdown**
- Formula: (Peak Value - Trough Value) / Peak Value
- Interpretation: Largest peak-to-trough decline
- Example: $120,000 → $100,000 → $120,000 = 16.7% max drawdown

---




# Performance Metrics: Measuring Success
## Slide 19: Sharpe Ratio

**Sharpe Ratio**

**Formula**: (Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Volatility

**Components:**
- **Return**: Strategy's average return
- **Risk-Free Rate**: Return on Treasury bills
- **Volatility**: Standard deviation of returns

**Example:**
- Strategy return: 12%
- Risk-free rate: 2%
- Volatility: 15%
- **Sharpe Ratio = (12% - 2%) / 15% = 0.67**

**Interpretation:**
- Higher is better
- Above 1.0 is good
- Above 2.0 is excellent
- Negative = underperforms risk-free assets

---




# Alpha: The Goal
## Slide 20: What is Alpha?

**Alpha**

The excess return of a strategy compared to a benchmark, adjusted for risk. It represents the "skill" component of returns.

**Alpha Formulas:**
- **Basic Alpha**: Strategy Return - Benchmark Return
- **Risk-Adjusted Alpha**: Strategy Return - (Risk-Free Rate + Beta × (Market Return - Risk-Free Rate))

**Key Point**: Alpha measures the value added by your strategy beyond what the market provides.

---




# Alpha: The Goal
## Slide 21: Sources of Alpha

**Sources of Alpha**

**1. Market Inefficiencies**
- Temporary price dislocations
- Information asymmetry
- Market frictions

**2. Behavioral Biases**
